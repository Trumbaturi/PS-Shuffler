# Shy's Pokemon Stadium Team Shuffler
This is a shuffler program that allows users to randomize their Pokemon Team for them to select in Pokemon Stadium 1, 2, or Pocket Monsters Stadium.
All the cups in each game are supported. This shuffler also has compatability with Mord's Rental Hack that allows for normally locked pokemon, to be playable in the Prime Cup.
The following pokemon get replaced in the Prime Cups:

  Pokemon Stadium 1:

    Kakuna -> Mew
  Pokemon Stadium 2:
    Caterpie -> Lugia
    Metapod -> Mewtwo
    Weedle -> Ho-oh
