# Shy's Pokemon Stadium Team Shuffler
This is a shuffler program that allows users to randomize their Pokemon Team for them to select in Pokemon Stadium 1, 2, or Pocket Monsters Stadium.
All the cups in each game are supported. In order to use the app, all you need to do is choose your settings then click randomize! You will receive 6 randomly chosen pokemon based on the applied settings. You may also click on individual slots to randomize that specific Pokemon.  
  
If you want to use this program on your Twitch stream, make absolutely sure before anything to crop the right side of the program by 193 pixels to get the cleanest output of the program for your livestream.
    
# Settings
When the app opens, the default settings are Pokemon Stadium 1, Gym Leader Castle / Poke Cup, No Sort.  
You have the following choices for the cups in each game.  
  
  Pocket Monsters Stadium:  
   Level 30  
   Level 50  

  Pokemon Stadium 1:  
   Prime Cup  
   Petit Cup  
   Pika Cup  
   Gym Leader Castle / Poke Cup 
  
  Pokemon Stadium 2:  
   Prime Cup  
   Little Cup  
   Gym Leader Castle / Poke Cup  
   
You may choose how the pokemon are sorted after they are randomized. For convenience, I recommend having Numerical Sort for Pocket Monsters Stadium and Pokemon Stadium 1 due to them not having any type of sorting feature aside from Pokedex number. Pokemon Stadium 2 has the ability to choose between Numerical or Alphabetical, the default is Alphabetical so in the end, do whatever is more convenient for you.

# Mord's Rental Hack
This shuffler also has compatability with Mord's Rental Hack (created by Mord_Fustang on romhacking.net) that allows for normally locked Pokemon to be playable in the Prime Cup. All you need to do is click the check box for this to take effect.
The following pokemon get replaced in the Prime Cups:

  Pokemon Stadium 1:  
   Metapod -> Mewtwo  
   Kakuna -> Mew  
  
  Pokemon Stadium 2:   
   Caterpie -> Lugia  
   Metapod -> Mewtwo  
   Weedle -> Ho-oh  
   Kakuna -> Mew

# Side Notes  
You may also add your own custom images for the Pokemon. Just name the image the number of the Pokemon. For example for Mewtwo, call the image "150.png", or Charmander, "4.png", and replace the respective image in the "\img" folder. The dimensions of the image is 300 x 300. The default images were designed by me. The renders for the pokmeon were all sourced from the galleries of Bulbapedia.
